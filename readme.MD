# Quizzy!

This project was started as a practice project. However, motivation was drawn
by my class' need for an app that can recieve questions and dispense them at
 need time.

-New description...

*This app's final version should be able to take input questions and options from 
users on different course...
*this is how it will go,
   + Each user will have a username, when that username is registered, the a
    space is opened for you in the database. Each space will have subfolders
    of names of courses, this subfolders will appear on the app as MY COURSES
    each course will have questions object that will have the following properties:
    - [ ] Question text
    - [ ] Options with the correct answer indicated
    -[ ] Question instruction

  + In subsequent logins, users are allowed to see the list of courses that have been created, they can click on them and start a quiz based on the pre-stored questions.


** For this project  you'll need to learn to use a database, most recommendable
firebase firestore.
